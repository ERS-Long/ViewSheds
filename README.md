# ViewSheds

This is a purely testing widget I put together to test the functionality of draw a viewshed and then export the shed to a shp file.
I did not refine the code at all. 

User hae to add the following reference line in the index.html

        <script type="text/javascript" src="lib/FileSaveTools.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="lib/JS2Shapefile.js"></script>           

in my map, i also use jquery stuff, so i have the following refernce line 
        <script type="text/javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>

my test shows it does not conflict with the jquery stuff i am using in my CMV project.
